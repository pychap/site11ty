### The Cook  
Hard to believe that some time back I started on my career path as a cook üë®‚Äçüç≥ ‚Äì in the Coast Guard. After my service stint I got into Architecture School at Arizona State, changed my major after a few years and graduated with a Graphic Communication's degree.  
After being in the workforce with my degree for about 6 years, I enrolled in a Multimedia Design program at Platt College.  I think that this was the pivotal moment in my life as I found I could digitally make and design things like I dreamed of in Architecture school. And, if I wanted to change what I made, I could do it instantly. 

### The Designer
Now I could apply my design sensibilities! In my next series of jobs I was designing for print, for web, and for Multimedia. I was learning to love all the challenges of design in a limited canvas (paper, web page), and I was taking classes at San Diego City college ‚Äì taught by accomplished local designers, learning to love typography as well.  

During this phase I honed my Photoshop skills and combined with my Photograpy hobby became a bit of a Ninja. 

### The UI Developer
Working for both Verizon, then [Thermofisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home.html) I evolved into doing only web design and helping with the HTML & CSS wherever I could. I began my love affair with CSS at this time and continue to be fascinated by what you can do with this language.  
Gradually I work on my proficiency with JavaScript, which really could be considered the "ultimate key to the web".
